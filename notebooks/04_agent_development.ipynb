      "The Indian IT sector is projected to reach a market size of approximately USD 350 billion by 2026, driven by robust demand for digital transformation and AI integration across various industries. However, revenue growth for major IT firms is expected to remain muted in the short term, with Q3 FY26 forecasts indicating growth rates between 0.2% and 1.7%. The adoption of AI technologies is accelerating, supported by government initiatives and a growing talent pool, although challenges related to workforce skills and infrastructure persist.\n",
